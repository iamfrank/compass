# Demo of a compass webapp

[Here is a demo of a mobile compass app](/dist) that uses web technologies.

## Uses Javascrip API

The app is essentially a web page that uses the javascript deviceOrientation API (via [gyronorm.js](https://github.com/dorukeker/gyronorm.js#gyronormjs)) to make a compass image point north if your device has a compass.

## Offline capable

You can access the demo and save it to your Home Screen on your mobile device. [Application cache](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_app_cache.asp) enables you to use the app while offline.
